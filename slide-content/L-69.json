The market crashed 70% in three months—$8,000 became $2,400. He sold in panic, locking in a $5,600 loss. The part that haunts him most: $8,000 invested at 22 in a diversified stock index fund, growing 7% annually until age 65, would have become approximately $123,000. By chasing speculation without a foundation, Alex lost both his savings and 43 years of compounding on that money.",
