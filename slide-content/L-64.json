          "scenario": "Marcus, 28, had carefully built $18,000 in a diversified index fund over three years. He then moved his entire portfolio into a single 'hot' biotech stock at $85/share. It climbed to $110—a 29% gain in two months. Then the company's drug failed clinical trials. The stock fell to $22 in a single day. Marcus's $18,000 became $5,976. He sold in panic. To recover his original amount, his remaining investment needs to grow 201%. Meanwhile, had he kept his index fund, the biotech's collapse would have affected only 0.1% of his portfolio.",
