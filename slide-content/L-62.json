After learning about asset location, he made a single change: moved bonds into the 401k and kept only stocks in the taxable account. Total portfolio allocation stayed identical. Result over 15 years: approximately $19,000 more in wealth—just from moving assets between accounts. No new money invested. No additional risk. Just strategic placement.",

She rebalanced back to 85/15 by selling $4,000 of stocks and buying bonds. Six months later, a 20% market correction hit. Her rebalanced portfolio fell 16.5% vs. 18% if she hadn't rebalanced—a $1,000+ difference. More importantly, she used the downturn to rebalance again, buying stocks at depressed prices with new contributions."
