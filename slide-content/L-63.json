          "scenario": "Jade, 26, heard friends celebrating Bitcoin gains. She invested $5,000 when Bitcoin was at $20,000. It soared to $60,000—her investment tripled to $15,000. Convinced, she invested another $5,000 at the peak. Then Bitcoin crashed to $15,000. Her $15,000 holding became $5,000. Meanwhile her boring stock index funds had grown 10%. After selling at a $5,000 loss, she kept 2% of her portfolio in crypto as 'speculation money' and returned to fundamentals. The expensive lesson: volatility works both directions—and fear of missing out is a terrible investment strategy.",

He chose 10% allocation ($24,000) to a diversified REIT fund covering residential, commercial, industrial, and healthcare properties. During COVID, his stocks fell 30% but residential REITs held steady, while industrial REITs (warehouses) actually gained—the diversification worked exactly as intended."
